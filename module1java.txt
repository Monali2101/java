Q4. World Wide Web & How Internet Works

[User’s Client Device (Browser/App)]
         |
         v
[DNS Server] ← resolves domain → gives Server IP
         |
         v
[Client (transport + network stack)]
         |
   (3-way handshake, possibly TLS)
         |
         v
[Network Routers / Switches / ISPs]  → many hops
         |
         v
[Server (listening on port, receiving packets)]
         |
   (Processes request: database, app logic, etc.)
         |
         v
[Server sends HTTP/HTTPS response packets]
         |
         v
[Network Routers → back to client]
         |
         v
[Client receives, reassembles, renders content]


Q4. Network Layers on Client and Server

 Layer                                                                                                  
Application Layer                                  
Transport Layer      
 Network / Internet Layer
Data Link Layer         
Physical Layer 

LAB EXERCISE: Design a simple HTTP client-server communication in any language
 
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class SimpleHTTPServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int port = 8080;

        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port)) {
            System.out.println("Server is listening on port " + port + "...");

            while (true) {
                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
                System.out.println("Connection from " + clientSocket.getInetAddress());

                // Read request from client
                BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
                String line;
                while (!(line = in.readLine()).isEmpty()) {
                    System.out.println(line);
                }

                // Send response to client
                PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream());
                out.println("HTTP/1.1 200 OK");
                out.println("Content-Type: text/plain");
                out.println(); // blank line between headers and body
                out.println("Hello from server!");
                out.flush();

                clientSocket.close();
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Q5. Explain Client Server Communication

Client-Server Model:

Client: Sends requests for resources/services.

Server: Listens for requests, processes them, and sends back responses.

Communication occurs via a network protocol (e.g., HTTP).

Usually request-response model: client initiates, server responds.

Q6. Types of Internet Connections.

Dial-up

Uses phone lines to connect to the internet.

Pros: Cheap, widely available.

Cons: Very slow, blocks phone line while connected.

DSL / Broadband

Uses phone lines but provides faster speed than dial-up.

Pros: Always-on connection, faster than dial-up.

Cons: Speed depends on distance from the exchange.

Cable

Uses cable TV lines to provide internet access.

Pros: High speed.

Cons: Shared bandwidth can reduce speed during peak hours.

Fiber-optic

Uses light signals through fiber cables.

Pros: Very fast, low latency, reliable.

Cons: Expensive, not available everywhere.

Satellite

Internet via satellite communication.

Pros: Available almost anywhere, good for remote areas.

Cons: High latency, affected by weather, expensive.

Mobile (3G / 4G / 5G)

Wireless internet using cellular networks.

Pros: Portable, convenient, decent speed.

Cons: Data limits, speed depends on coverage and network congestion.

Difference between Broadband and Fiber-optic:

Broadband: General high-speed internet (DSL, cable).

Fiber-optic: Uses light signals, faster and more reliable, supports higher bandwidth
